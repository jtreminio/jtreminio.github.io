Last night I gave my first presentation ever to my local PHP user group,
[DallasPHP](https://twitter.com/dallasphp). I’d like to thank the people who came
out to see me harp on the benefits of testing and the process of writing tests!

In the coming weeks I’ll be creating a very in-depth, multi-part series of articles
to be posted here taking you from the process of installing PHPUnit to writing
awesome unit and integration tests!

If you’re a complete newbie to testing, this series should bring you up to speed
and have you writing tests out the wazoo in no time!

In the meantime, here is my Powerpoint presentation from last night:

[Unit Tests: Using PHPUnit to Test Your Code](../static/post/2012-10-10-testing-with-phpunit-my-first-presentation/phpunit.presentation.pptx)
and [PDF version](../static/post/2012-10-10-testing-with-phpunit-my-first-presentation/phpunit.presentation.pdf).

Of course a big part of this presentation was me actually talking and pointing to
things.

[Bob Majdak Jr](https://twitter.com/bobmajdakjr) was kind enough to record the
presentation, but we’re still waiting on ustream to provide us the link! Will update
here as soon as I get it.

edit: Looks like Bob made a mistake and the video was *not* uploaded. Oh well!

Thanks again to those who came by!
