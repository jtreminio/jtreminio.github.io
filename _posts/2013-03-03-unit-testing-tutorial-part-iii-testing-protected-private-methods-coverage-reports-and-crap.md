A common question I keep hearing repeated is, "How much do I test?".

A common response is, "Until you have 100% code coverage.".

In this third part of my unit testing tutorial, I will explain what code coverage is
and why 100% of it may not be what you should aim for.

But first, how to test your private/protected methods!

### PROTECTED/PRIVATE METHOD TESTING

If you look at the second part of this series, you will notice that we instantiate
our class to be tested via a regular `new` call. You may also be left wondering how
to test protected or private methods if you are unable to access them directly via
the instantiated object ( `$url->someProtectedMethod()` ).

Usually the answer would be, "You do not test protected/private methods directly.".
Since anything non-public is only accessible within the scope of the class, we assume
that your class's public methods (its API) will interact with them, so in the end you
are actually indirectly testing these methods anyway.

Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule: What if you are testing an abstract
class that defines a protected methods but does not actually interact with it?

What if you want to test different scenarios for a particular method and do not have
the opportunity to go through your public methods?

I will explain the process!

#### Stupid user class

Create a new file at `./phpUnitTutorial/User.php` and paste the following:

{% blockquote danger %}
> Let me be very clear: the `User` class is *not* a good class. Using `md5()` for
> passwords should be avoided at all costs! In fact, it is a pretty bad class
> overall. That said, it provides a very simple and easy to grasp example of what I
> am teaching.
{% endblockquote %}

```php
<?php

namespace phpUnitTutorial;

class User
{
    const MIN_PASS_LENGTH = 4;

    private $user = array();

    public function __construct(array $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }

    public function getUser()
    {
        return $this->user;
    }

    public function setPassword($password)
    {
        if (strlen($password) < self::MIN_PASS_LENGTH) {
            return false;
        }

        $this->user['password'] = $this->cryptPassword($password);

        return true;
    }

    private function cryptPassword($password)
    {
        return md5($password);
    }
}
```

Our test would instantiate the User class using `$user = new User($details);`.

You can access the `::setPassword()` method, but are unable to call
`::cryptPassword()` - but in this case, you do not have to! The fact that your
public method interacts with the private method is enough to say, "This method
is tested.", at least with this particular code!

So, how would you create your test for this method? You can see the constructor
and `::setPassword()` methods both require a parameter. PHPUnit requires no special
magic to work with method parameters, as you will soon see.

#### Creating your test

Create your empty test at `./phpUnitTutorial/Test/UserTest.php` and setup the
skeleton:

```php
<?php

namespace phpUnitTutorial\Test;

class UserTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    //
}
```

Running your test suite will result in an error:

```
1) Warning
No tests found in class "phpUnitTutorial\Test\UserTest".
```

This is great because it tells us PHPUnit has picked up this test and it is ready
for actual code!

We should identify what we would like to test before we go any further. As the
`phpUnitTutorial\User` class is very simple, we can quickly see two scenarios:

1. `::setPassword()` returns `true` when password is set, and
2. `::getUser()` returns the user array, which would contain the new password
   which we would then compare against expected result.

We will start with `::setPassword()` returning `true`. Create the empty method:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testSetPasswordReturnsTrueWhenPasswordSuccessfullySet()
{
    //
}
```

The `phpUnitTutorial\User` constructor is expecting a parameter, so define it
before instantiating the object:

```php
<?php

namespace phpUnitTutorial\Test;

use phpUnitTutorial\User;

class UserTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function testSetPasswordReturnsTrueWhenPasswordSuccessfullySet()
    {
        $details = array();

        $user = new User($details);
    }
}
```

Note I have added a `use` statement.

We will now define the parameter required for the `::setPassword()` method, and
then call it:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testSetPasswordReturnsTrueWhenPasswordSuccessfullySet()
{
    $details = array();

    $user = new User($details);

    $password = 'fubar';

    $result = $user->setPassword($password);
}
```

We expect `$result` to equal `true`, and I know just the assertion to use,
`assertTrue()`! Here is our completed test:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testSetPasswordReturnsTrueWhenPasswordSuccessfullySet()
{
    $details = array();

    $user = new User($details);

    $password = 'fubar';

    $result = $user->setPassword($password);

    $this->assertTrue($result);
}
```

If you run your test suite, you will get a nice green bar for your troubles.

We can now focus on testing `::getUser()`, which is a one-line method so it
should be very simple to test, right? Well... not exactly. You see, the whole
reason to even test `::getUser()` is to give us access to the private, and
therefor inaccessible `$user` property. We want to verify that the `$user`
property has values that we expect - like passwords structured in the correct
way.

What this means is that by testing `::getUser()` we are also going to end up
testing `::__construct()`, `::setPassword()` and `::cryptPassword()`.

Here is our empty test:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testGetUserReturnsUserWithExpectedValues()
{
    //
}
```

The only thing we can really test in our particular scenario is that the password
that was created by `::cryptPassword()` matches our expectations. First, set up
the method similar to how we did with
`::testSetPasswordReturnsTrueWhenPasswordSuccessfullySet()`:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testGetUserReturnsUserWithExpectedValues()
{
    $details = array();

    $user = new User($details);

    $password = 'fubar';

    $user->setPassword($password);
}
```

We do not catch the result of `::setPassword()` because we are going to assume
it passed. If it did not pass, we will know for sure in the next steps.

We know our raw password is `fubar`. We can see that this password is "hashed"
in `::setPassword()` using `md5()`. Therefor we can define what we expect our
result to actually be:

`$expectedPasswordResult = '5185e8b8fd8a71fc80545e144f91faf2';`

We then call `::getUser()` to get the user in its current state:

`$currentUser = $user->getUser();`

What are we expecting our test to actually do?

We are expecting `::getUser()` to return an array, and we want to compare
the `password` key to our expected value. The perfect assertion for this would
be `assertEquals()`. Here is our completed test:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testGetUserReturnsUserWithExpectedValues()
{
    $details = array();

    $user = new User($details);

    $password = 'fubar';

    $user->setPassword($password);

    $expectedPasswordResult = '5185e8b8fd8a71fc80545e144f91faf2';

    $currentUser = $user->getUser();

    $this->assertEquals($expectedPasswordResult, $currentUser['password']);
}
```

PHPUnit seems to have liked our test:

`OK (9 tests, 9 assertions)`

#### Targeting private/protected methods directly

What if we simply want to write more scenarios for a protected method? What if
we do not want to go through the public API directly, and instead want to interact
solely with the protected method?

There are scenarios where this would be a legitimate need. I will not go through
those possible scenarios today (I will in an upcoming part of my series!), but
suffice it to say that with a little creative thinking, you can access your
instantiated objects' privates rather easily:

```php
<?php
// ...

/**
 * Call protected/private method of a class.
 *
 * @param object &$object    Instantiated object that we will run method on.
 * @param string $methodName Method name to call
 * @param array  $parameters Array of parameters to pass into method.
 *
 * @return mixed Method return.
 */
public function invokeMethod(&$object, $methodName, array $parameters = array())
{
    $reflection = new \ReflectionClass(get_class($object));
    $method = $reflection->getMethod($methodName);
    $method->setAccessible(true);

    return $method->invokeArgs($object, $parameters);
}
```

Using `invokeMethod()` you can easily call your private or protected methods
directly without having to go through public methods.

To use, you simply do

```php
<?php
// ...

$this->invokeMethod($user, 'cryptPassword', array('passwordToCrypt'));
```

This would be the equivalent of simply typing

```php
<?php
// ...

$user->cryptPassword('passwordToCrypt');
```

assuming `::cryptPassword()` were public.

### COVERAGE REPORT

Imagine you have a large codebase, as well as several hundred unit tests. You are
confident that most of your code is well-tested, but you need to make sure.

You could go through each test and manually verify that every bit of your codebase
is covered, but that sounds boring, and like a lot of work. Programmers love
being lazy, and thankfully there is a very powerful tool that ships with PHPUnit
that allows us to continue being lazy!

The coverage report tool generates static HTML files for you to browse through
and immediately see statistics of your codebase, including how much is covered
by tests and how complicated your code is.

It will even tell you if you have missed any possible routes through our tested
code, like not triggering an `if` statement and running the code inside the block,
for example.

#### Generating a coverage report

To generate, simply pass the `--coverage-html` flag to PHPUnit, along with the
destination to have the files generated. I usually use a folder `coverage`:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage
```

{% image 300px %}
![01-coverage-report.png](/static/post/2013-03-03-unit-testing-tutorial-part-iii-testing-protected-private-methods-coverage-reports-and-crap/01-coverage-report.png)
{% endimage %}

If you look at your filesystem now, you will see that a `coverage` folder has been
created and filled with HTML files. Open the `index.html` file and you will see:

{% image 300px %}
![02-coverage-report-dashboard.png](/static/post/2013-03-03-unit-testing-tutorial-part-iii-testing-protected-private-methods-coverage-reports-and-crap/02-coverage-report-dashboard.png)
{% endimage %}

[message info]If you are using an older PHPUnit version, it may look slightly different as the CSS was changed in a recent update![/message]

Ignore the `vendor` folder, focus instead on your own code. Click into
`phpUnitTutorial` and you will see two entries for the two files you currently
have.

#### Wait, only 2?

That is right, astute reader! You actually have 3 test files, and one of them is
not listed on this page: `StupidTest.php`. That is because this test does not
actually correspond to any code within our codebase, so PHPUnit did not generate
a coverage report for it.

#### URL test coverage

Click into `URL.php` in the coverage report, and you will see:

{% image 300px %}
![03-url.php-coverage-report.png](/static/post/2013-03-03-unit-testing-tutorial-part-iii-testing-protected-private-methods-coverage-reports-and-crap/03-url.php-coverage-report.png)
{% endimage %}

Looking at the legend at the bottom of the page tells you that green is executed
code, red is not executed, and yellow is dead code. In this particular example,
all the lines with code are green. If you hover over one of the lines, a small
info box will popup and show you which tests cover this particular line:

{% image 300px %}
![04-line-covered-by.png](/static/post/2013-03-03-unit-testing-tutorial-part-iii-testing-protected-private-methods-coverage-reports-and-crap/04-line-covered-by.png)
{% endimage %}

This code is really straightforward, so it may not have the impact to make you
go, "Cool!", but it gives you a taste of what is to come.

#### User test coverage

Go back a page and click into `User.php`:

{% image 300px %}
![05-uncovered-line.png](/static/post/2013-03-03-unit-testing-tutorial-part-iii-testing-protected-private-methods-coverage-reports-and-crap/05-uncovered-line.png)
{% endimage %}

Looking at this report, you can immediately tell that something is red.

Specifically, the `if` statement inside `::setPassword()` never resolves to `true`
in any of our tests, so the code inside of it is never run.

For this particular `if` statement, the contents are extremely simple: it returns
`false`.

Go back to `phpUnitTutorial\Test\UserTest` and create a new method to test this
scenario:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testSetPasswordReturnsFalseWhenPasswordLengthIsTooShort()
{
    //
}
```

In a previous test, `::testSetPasswordReturnsTrueWhenPasswordSuccessfullySet()`,
the password we passed in to `::setPassword()` was 5 characters in length. To
trigger the `if` block, we need to pass in a password that is less than 4
characters in length. The rest is pretty much the same as before:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testSetPasswordReturnsFalseWhenPasswordLengthIsTooShort()
{
    $details = array();

    $user = new User($details);

    $password = 'fub';

    $result = $user->setPassword($password);
}
```

We are expecting `$result` to be `false`. There is an assertion for that!
`assertFalse()` returns `true` if the value you pass it is `false`. Here is our
completed test:

```php
<?php
// ...

public function testSetPasswordReturnsFalseWhenPasswordLengthIsTooShort()
{
    $details = array();

    $user = new User($details);

    $password = 'fub';

    $result = $user->setPassword($password);

    $this->assertFalse($result);
}
```

Run your test suite and you get `OK (10 tests, 10 assertions)`.

Re-run your coverage report, reload the page, and you should now see that red line
has turned to green. If you hover over it, it will tell you this new test now covers
it.

{% image 300px %}
![06-user.php-coverage-report.png](/static/post/2013-03-03-unit-testing-tutorial-part-iii-testing-protected-private-methods-coverage-reports-and-crap/06-user.php-coverage-report.png)
{% endimage %}

### PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR CRAP

If you look at the top of your coverage reports, you will see a column labeled "CRAP".

Officially it stands for "Change Risk Analysis and Predictions", but I like to think
of it as how hard it will be to come back to a particular method in the future and
figure out what exactly is going on.

[A thorough description of the CRAP index can be found here](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=210575).

I would not blame you for quickly closing that link. It is a bit dry, maybe a little
boring if you are not really interested in the intricacies of what the CRAP index is.

Suffice it to say, the higher your method's CRAP index, the harder it is to understand.

If your code is extremely simple - is little more than a getter, then its CRAP index
is close to 1 (1 being the lowest value possible). If your code is a little more complex,
say with a few `if` blocks, your CRAP value starts creeping up.

If you throw a few `foreach` and nested statements, your CRAP will shoot right up!

As you write tests to cover the different execution pathways your CRAP index will
start climbing down. Once the method is fully covered, the final number will usually
be much lower than the number shown when no tests cover it.

So far our code has been fairly simple and to the point. There are not very many
different pathways of execution, keeping our CRAP fairly low. This is the way I
prefer to code: small, but plentiful methods doing very specific tasks. Not only
is this much easier for a human to comprehend, but it allows more versatile refactoring
of code while still allowing your tests to continue passing.

### 100% CODE COVERAGE AND WHY IT IS NOT NEEDED

Many developers espouse the notion of writing unit tests until you have complete,
100% coverage. The arguments sound eerily similar to the tabs vs spaces crowd, so
I tried lightly.

I do not believe 100% code coverage is needed: if your method has a CRAP index < 5,
it is not complex enough to warrant a test.

That said, a method with a CRAP index < 5 is probably simple enough that a test for
it would take less than 5 minutes to write, so the decision of how much time
you want to dedicate to writing basic tests is ultimately up to you!

### WRAPPING UP

Today you learned that testing private/protected methods can be done either
indirectly, or "cheating" using the `ReflectionClass` class.

You also learned how to use the amazingly useful code coverage generator to track
down code that had not been covered, and I possibly convinced you that writing
100% test coverage is unnecessary.

I believe we are finally at the stage that we can introduce more advanced concepts,
like mock objects and mock/stub methods, the awesomeness (and necessity) that is
dependency injection and/or service container and tracking down unforeseen issues
when refactoring code.

All that and more is coming up in my next chapter!

Until next time, this is Señor PHP Developer Juan Treminio wishing you adios!
