Docker is an excellent tool for local web development. It allows creating
non-trivial environments without polluting the local system with tools.

There are still some things that make working with it just a tad bit harder
than necessary.

Today's topic involves running Docker containers using the local host system's
current logged-in user.

## The Problem

You are working on a project that requires Node NPM, PHP Composer or a similar
tool that downloads or compiles outside dependencies or assets for you.

You do not want to install the language (PHP, Node) locally to run this tool,
so you choose to run a Docker container. Here is how it would look like to spin
up a container with PHP Composer support:

```bash
docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 composer require psr/log
```

This starts a temporary container using my
[PHP 7.2 image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jtreminio/php/) that has Composer
pre-installed and runs `composer require psr/log`.

It generates the following:

```bash
$ ls -la
total 20K
drwxrwxr-x. 3 jtreminio jtreminio 4.0K Aug  4 19:34 ./
drwxr-xr-x. 7 jtreminio jtreminio 4.0K Aug  4 19:31 ../
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root      root      4.0K Aug  4 19:34 vendor/
-rw-r--r--. 1 root      root        53 Aug  4 19:34 composer.json
-rw-r--r--. 1 root      root      2.1K Aug  4 19:34 composer.lock
```

Although it _works_ as intended, the problem is that the directories and files
generated by Composer are root-owned.

Since I do not use root, attempting to do anything other than read the files is
blocked:

```bash
$ echo '' > composer.json 
bash: composer.json: Permission denied
```

You have to `sudo` to edit or remove everything. This quickly gets old when your
project uses Composer, Webpack, Yarn, etc because your system becomes littered
with root-owned files and directories.

## The Reason

Docker on Linux runs as a daemon. The official installation instructions
recommend installing as root and selectively adding users to the `docker` group
so they can run all Docker commands.

```bash
$ ps -fe | grep dockerd
255:root      2356     1  0 Aug03 ?        00:04:06 /usr/bin/dockerd
```

When you create a new container it does not get created as your current user,
but as root, which the daemon is running under.

We can verify that the container runs as `root` with user/group ID `0:0`:

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 whoami
root
```

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 \
        bash -c "echo \$(id -u \${USER}):\$(id -g \${USER})"
0:0
```

## So run as your local user, right?

When you run Docker containers you can specify a user ID, plus a group ID. It
is easy enough to do:

```bash
docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 composer require psr/log
```

This generates the following:

```bash
$ ls -la
total 20K
drwxrwxr-x. 3 jtreminio jtreminio 4.0K Aug  4 20:09 ./
drwxr-xr-x. 7 jtreminio jtreminio 4.0K Aug  4 19:31 ../
drwxr-xr-x. 4 jtreminio jtreminio 4.0K Aug  4 20:09 vendor/
-rw-r--r--. 1 jtreminio jtreminio   53 Aug  4 20:09 composer.json
-rw-r--r--. 1 jtreminio jtreminio 2.1K Aug  4 20:09 composer.lock
```

{% blockquote info %}
> In my system, my user `jtreminio` has user ID `1000` and group ID `1000`, so
> the new line
> 
> ```-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER})```
> 
> gets interpreted as
> 
> ```-u 1000:1000```
{% endblockquote %}

This does exactly what we want, but of course there is a catch: the container
user is no longer root, or whatever the author decided to use. On Composer and
NPM this simply means any internal cache directories cannot be written to since
they are root-owned, but that really is not much of a problem because we are
tearing the containers down as soon as they finish running what we told them
to.

The Composer container above is deleted as soon as `composer require psr/log`
finishes executing.

What if you want to run a web app with PHP-FPM? It must be able to create its
PID file at `/var/run/php-fpm.pid`, if you are using file-based sessions it
must write to `/var/lib/php/sessions`. Any number of things that require root
or a predefined user will no longer work because the container is
_running using your user/group ID_:

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 whoami
whoami: cannot find name for user ID 1000
```

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 \
        bash -c "echo \$(id -u \${USER}):\$(id -g \${USER})"
1000:1000
```

If you try to do anything that requires elevated permissions or a specific
user, you will be denied:

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 ls -la /var/lib/php/sessions
total 8
drwxr-xr-x. 1 www-data www-data 4096 Jul  9 12:35 .
drwxr-xr-x. 1 root     root     4096 Jul 26 09:08 ..
```

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 touch /var/lib/php/sessions/foo
touch: cannot touch '/var/lib/php/sessions/foo': Permission denied
```

The above means running the PHP-FPM daemon as your local user will quickly
encounter permissions issues. In this case it is because
`/var/lib/php/sessions` is owned by `www-data:www-data` which most likely does
not share your local user's IDs:

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 \
        bash -c "echo \$(id -u www-data):\$(id -g www-data)"
33:33
```

## OK, run it as an non-root internal user?

So far we have found that

* root works great inside the container but is annoying to work with on the
    host system, and
* your local user works great on your host system, but will quickly run
    into permission problems inside the container.

What if we try to run the containers as a non-root user that has required
permissions to write inside the container directories?

Try with the container's internal `www-data` user:

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u www-data \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 \
        bash -c "touch /var/lib/php/sessions/foo && echo \$?"
0
```

As expected this worked fine, but if you try running Composer:

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u www-data \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 composer require psr/log

[ErrorException]                                                              
file_put_contents(./composer.json): failed to open stream: Permission denied  
```

The problem is that the internal container user `www-data` with user/group ID
`33:33`, does not have write permissions to my host's current directory:

```bash
$ ls -la
total 8.0K
drwxrwxr-x. 2 jtreminio jtreminio 4.0K Aug  4 20:34 ./
drwxr-xr-x. 7 jtreminio jtreminio 4.0K Aug  4 19:31 ../
```

We might as well add another grievance to our list:

* non-root internal user with required permissions works great inside the
    container but completely falters on host system with volumes.

## Why is this happening?

Host and containers do not share users and groups. 

On my local system, there is no `www-data` user:

```bash
$ groups www-data
groups: ‘www-data’: no such user
```

Similarly, if I try using my direct username to run the container I see errors:

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u jtreminio \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 whoami
docker: Error response from daemon: linux spec user: unable to find user jtreminio: no matching entries in passwd file.
```

As far as the container is aware, it is its own separate system with its own 
list of users at `/etc/passwd` and list of groups at `/etc/group`. It has no
idea about any users or groups that exist on the host system. Likewise, the
host does not know about users in the container. By convention root is `0:0`
which will match any Linux system, but anything else is up to each distro
and each image author.

## Try sharing `/etc/passwd`!

Now we know that the

* host system does not know about container's `/etc/passwd`, and
* container does not know about the host system's `/etc/passwd`

What happens if we bind the host's `/etc/passwd` to the container's?

Not much as you would think, actually. My host system still does not have a
user matching `33:33`, so even if I bind the `/etc/passwd` into the container,
attempting to write to `www-data`-owned directories still will not work.

This is because Linux permissions are not name-based, but ID-based.

For example, on my local system:

```bash
$ ls -lan
total 8.0K
drwxrwxr-x. 2 1000 1000 4.0K Aug  4 20:34 ./
drwxr-xr-x. 7 1000 1000 4.0K Aug  4 19:31 ../
```

and in the container:

```bash
$ docker container run --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/var/www \
    -w /var/www \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    jtreminio/php:7.2 ls -lan /var/lib/php/sessions
total 8
drwxr-xr-x. 1 33 33 4096 Jul  9 12:35 .
drwxr-xr-x. 1  0  0 4096 Jul 26 09:08 ..
```

In the container `www-data:www-data` is simply an alias to `33:33`.

## User namespaces

The container does not care what user and group name is used, it simply wants
the IDs to match.

There is a concept in Docker Engine called _User Namespaces_.
[Here is a great introduction to them.](https://www.jujens.eu/posts/en/2017/Jul/02/docker-userns-remap/) 

The concept boils down to mapping the internal container user/group IDs to
reflect different values.

For example, you can tell Docker to use your current user/group ID as the
"floor" for container IDs. In my example, my `jtreminio` account with
`1000:1000` would map directly to `0:0` in a container.

In other words, we tell Docker to consider our current user on the host as root
in containers! Local system user ID `1000` maps directly to container user ID
`0`.

User namespaces would allow us to run all containers as root internally which
would completely eliminate any permission issues, and any generated files and
directories on shared volumes would be owned by the host user/group so we
would no longer need to `sudo` to edit or delete them.

This sounds exactly what we need, right? There is a catch (because of course
there is)... in fact, multiple catches!

#### You are running the container as root

Normally this would be a security concern. Countless articles and guides
strongly recommend _not_ running as root in containers.

In this case, this is not the problem, because the container's internal root
maps to our current, non-root user on host.

The problem actually comes down to root being able to do anything and
everything in the container, which opens the door to unforeseen permissions
issues when you deploy to production, where you would not be using user
namespaces.

In production, most containers will run as non-root, with permissions
specifically tailored for that user/group ID. Attempting to do anything the
user is not permitted will rightfully result in permissions denied errors. This
is a safety feature you _want_, and running as root completely ignores this.

You might run as root on your local system and everything works perfectly fine.
You are happy, files are generated as expected, all actions are permitted and
you are a happy developer. Once you deploy to production you may suddenly
realize that you were developing on a system very much unlike production.
Something that worked flawlessly on your development system can easily break
on production due to insufficient permissions for whatever user is running
the container service.

#### Your user/group ID is the _floor_, it goes up! 

Your user/group ID maps directly to `0:0` in the container, but there are more
accounts than just the one root and none of them are mapped to your host user.

This means that while `0:0` maps to my host system's `1000:1000`, the
container's `www-data` user with IDs `33:33` would map to my host system's
`1033:1033`, which does not exist.

Anything done as non-root in the container will run against the same issues we
saw earlier: what might be considered sufficient permissions inside the
container will probably not work the same on your host.

My host's directories are still owned by `1000:1000` and a user with
`1033:1033` will be denied.

#### All containers on your system are affected

If the previous two reasons are not enough, the fact that Docker does not come
with User Namespaces support enabled by default, to enable it requires editing
a JSON config file and restarting the Docker daemon, and now all your
existing and future containers will implement namespaces whether you want them
to or not should be enough to make you question if it is worth the hassle.

## Ok so what actually works?

The only sure-fire way of resolving all previous issues and getting on with
Making the World a Better Place is completely replacing the internal user/group
IDs with known, good values.

In the container, `www-data` maps to `33:33`. Why not change it so it maps to
my host system's `jtreminio` with `1000:1000`?

In other words, make the container's `www-data` user/group ID be `1000:1000`.

You cannot change an existing account's user/group IDs. Remember, the user and
group names are simply aliases to the IDs. You can _rename_ `www-data` to
anything you want but the IDs will not change.

The only thing you can do is _delete_ and _recreate_ the user/group completely.

For this we will need to create a Dockerfile. We need to recreate the user
before any potential entrypoint scripts are run. Unknown issues can and will
occur if you attempt to delete a user/group while it is in use by another
process.

First, delete the user and group:

```dockerfile
FROM jtreminio/php:7.2

RUN userdel -f www-data &&\
    if getent group www-data ; then groupdel www-data; fi
```

We test if the group actually exists before trying to delete, to avoid possible
errors when the group does not exist.

Next, we can generate the user and group with our IDs:

```dockerfile
FROM jtreminio/php:7.2

ARG USER_ID=1000
ARG GROUP_ID=1000

RUN userdel -f www-data &&\
    if getent group www-data ; then groupdel www-data; fi &&\
    groupadd -g ${GROUP_ID} www-data &&\
    useradd -l -u ${USER_ID} -g www-data www-data &&\
    install -d -m 0755 -o www-data -g www-data /home/www-data
```

After we delete the user and group, we recreate it with the defined values.

`1000` is my user and group ID, and now the container's `www-data` has the
same.

{% blockquote danger %}
> Remember to use the `-l` flag with `useradd`! There is an amazingly fun issue
> where a high UID value will generate huge log files and freeze your system!
> [Click here for all the juicy details](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/5419).
{% endblockquote %}

We also take the time to generate a home directory for our new user. This makes
it much easier to have your container perform SSH actions using your host's SSH
keys as long as you bind a volume.

Even though we are done with recreating the user and group, there is a problem:
Any files and directories that were owned by the `www-data` user will not
automatically point to the new ID values. Since the names are just _labels_,
`/var/lib/php/sessions` is still owned by `33:33`, not matching our spiffy new
`1000:1000`!

This is the part where you need to know just enough about the container you
want to run that you can pinpoint which files and directories you need to
update the owner for.

Thankfully, the rallying cry of containers is to have them do one single thing,
which limits the number of places we need to update. In this image, it is not
very many at all:

```dockerfile
FROM jtreminio/php:7.2

ARG USER_ID=1000
ARG GROUP_ID=1000

RUN userdel -f www-data &&\
    if getent group www-data ; then groupdel www-data; fi &&\
    groupadd -g ${GROUP_ID} www-data &&\
    useradd -l -u ${USER_ID} -g www-data www-data &&\
    install -d -m 0755 -o www-data -g www-data /home/www-data &&\
    chown --changes --silent --no-dereference --recursive \
          --from=33:33 ${USER_ID}:${GROUP_ID} \
        /home/www-data \
        /.composer \
        /var/run/php-fpm \
        /var/lib/php/sessions
```

You can figure out what you need by looking at the Dockerfile used to generate
the image. For the
[`jtreminio/php:7.2`](https://github.com/jtreminio/php-docker/blob/master/php7.2/Dockerfile)
image we can see that `/.composer`, `/var/run/php-fpm` and
`/var/lib/php/sessions` directories need updated.

Finally, it does not hurt to be explicit about the user we want to run the
container:

```dockerfile
FROM jtreminio/php:7.2

ARG USER_ID=1000
ARG GROUP_ID=1000

RUN userdel -f www-data &&\
    if getent group www-data ; then groupdel www-data; fi &&\
    groupadd -g ${GROUP_ID} www-data &&\
    useradd -l -u ${USER_ID} -g www-data www-data &&\
    install -d -m 0755 -o www-data -g www-data /home/www-data &&\
    chown --changes --silent --no-dereference --recursive \
          --from=33:33 ${USER_ID}:${GROUP_ID} \
        /home/www-data \
        /.composer \
        /var/run/php-fpm \
        /var/lib/php/sessions
        
USER www-data
```

If you run the container now, you will automatically become the `www-data` user
which now has user/group ID `1000:1000`. Any files generated by this container
will be owned by my host system's user.

What should we do about the hard-coded IDs, though? Your coworkers may have
different IDs on their machines.

## Make it dynamic

You can pass arguments when building an image using `--build-arg`.

Update the Dockerfile first:

```dockerfile
FROM jtreminio/php:7.2

ARG USER_ID
ARG GROUP_ID

RUN if [ ${USER_ID:-0} -ne 0 ] && [ ${GROUP_ID:-0} -ne 0 ]; then \
    userdel -f www-data &&\
    if getent group www-data ; then groupdel www-data; fi &&\
    groupadd -g ${GROUP_ID} www-data &&\
    useradd -l -u ${USER_ID} -g www-data www-data &&\
    install -d -m 0755 -o www-data -g www-data /home/www-data &&\
    chown --changes --silent --no-dereference --recursive \
          --from=33:33 ${USER_ID}:${GROUP_ID} \
        /home/www-data \
        /.composer \
        /var/run/php-fpm \
        /var/lib/php/sessions \
;fi
        
USER www-data
```

We make both `USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` optional. If both are not defined, we
skip the whole user delete/recreate process completely. This Dockerfile can
now be used for both dev and production purposes.

To build the above image you would do:

```bash
$ docker image build \
    --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u ${USER}) \
    --build-arg GROUP_ID=$(id -g ${USER}) \
    -t php_test \
    .

## User Docker Compose

You can take the `docker image build` command and save it to a bash file for
easy execution.

However, most folks would rather use Docker Compose for local development.

Here is what your `docker-compose.yml` might look like:

```yaml
version: '3.2'
services:
  php:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        USER_ID: $(id -u ${USER})
        GROUP_ID: $(id -g ${USER})
    volumes:
      - ${HOME}/.composer:/.composer
      - ${PWD}:/var/www
    ports:
      - 9000:9000
```

Unfortunately, Docker Compose cannot parse commands, so `$(id -u ${USER})`
would not work in the YAML file. Thankfully we can use `.env` file to pass values:

```yaml

We now have a PHP-FPM container running with my system user/group ID
`1000:1000` waiting for connections from Nginx or Apache.

## What containers need this?

Not all containers actually require these steps. For simpler images like the
official Nginx or Apache that do not generate files you would be interested in
editing while in development, you can skip this and let the container run as
the normal internal user.

For containers that only fetch dependencies to local disk, like PHP Composer
or Node NPM, you can get by with simply passing your user/group ID directly.
The container will complain about a user not existing for those values, but
will otherwise work fine. Cache directories may need a little bit of work.

Containers with long-running daemons that generate a large amount of files,
like parsing SCSS to CSS, will benefit you greatly to implement this concept.

## MacOS and Windows users...

You do not actually need to do any of this. Like, this whole article, you can
skip it. Docker does not actually run natively on either of these operating
systems, but transparently in a virtual machine.

This virtual machine is run under whatever user installed Docker, which is
usually not root on MacOS or administrator on Windows.

While _you_ do not need this, it is still a good idea to implement it. Your
coworkers that run Linux as their main OS will benefit greatly, and if you ever
make the switch you will already have your Docker stuff up to date.

You will also only require a single Dockerfile between all your coworkers.

## Wrapping it up

While you _can_ run all containers as the default internal user, dedicating
just a few minutes per image to switch to your user/group ID will help
eliminate one fairly big point of frustration.

Overall Docker is an amazing technology but little things like this can mar an
otherwise enjoyable experience. Knowing how to smooth the bumps will help make
Docker's promise of Nirvana come true.

Until next time, this is Señor PHP Developer Juan Treminio wishing you adios!
