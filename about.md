# Hello!

I am a Texas-based web developer with a strong focus on PHP and the LAMP stack. As you
can tell, I have a fascination with testable code. If you are looking for an
experienced developer to create a new application, write new features into an existing
application, or help you make your application better by creating tests or refactoring
code then we should get in touch!

I have been developing websites and applications for over a decade, starting with a
humble person blog to large, enterprise-level learning management systems (LMS).

I am a big advocate of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and unit testing in general. My
ideal day is creating awesome code that comes fully vetted by tests!

I have given presentations to my local user group on unit testing and virtualizing
development environments, as well as written several tutorials on several different
concepts.

My fascination with testing stems from the significant boost in confidence in code I
write, knowing it is covered in many different scenarions and will continue to work as
intended after further updates.

In addition to unit tests I am also a huge proponent of integration and behavorial
testing - different techniques that simply provide even more confidence and vetting to
my code.

> If you don’t like unit testing your product, most likely your customers won’t like
  to test it either.

I am available for long and short term projects, big and small. Whether you require a
developer for backend PHP and MySQL or frontend HTML, CSS or Javascript, I will be able
to assist you on getting your idea built and released.

If you have any comments, questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to
get in touch through any of my available methods:
