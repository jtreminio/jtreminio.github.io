## Need a web developer? Hire me!

I am a full-stack senior web developer with a strong focus on backend development.

I can take your idea and build it from the ground up. This includes everything from
server creation and management, PHP backend and API endpoints, HTML5/CSS/Javascript
frontend, complete testing suite, build systems and deployment process.

I am available for short-term and long-term contract projects, but perform my work
after-hours. This means your work will be done during the night or weekends, and it
will be completed in a timely, professional manner.

To quickly get in touch with me, email me at [jtreminio@gmail.com](mailto:jtreminio@gmail.com).

### PHP / MySQL Backend Development

I have extensive experience with PHP. I am familiar with multiple frameworks with my
go-to being Symfony 2.

I have created a number of [free, open source projects](https://github.com/jtreminio?tab=repositories)
and have contributed to many more. My [most popular FOSS, PuPHPet](https://puphpet.com)
has over 3,200 stars on Github and is the most popular service of its kind. It has inspired
other developers to create similar services.

My code comes fully tested. My articles on PHPUnit are
[currently the most popular on Google for "PHPUnit Tutorial"](https://www.google.com/search?q=phpunit+tutorial),
second only to the official documentation. My writing on PHPUnit has been extremely well-received
within the PHP developer community.

### Puppet / Server Management / Devops

[My PuPHPet project](https://puphpet.com) has [over 2.5 million](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/puphpet)
unique downloads, with millions more servers being spun up using cached files that are not counted.

Hundreds of thousands of developers around the world are using PuPHPet for development
and production purposes.

My project can deploy new virtual machines across multiple providers including Amazon EC2,
Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode, Google Compute Engine, and more!

It can quickly set up and manage new services like Nginx, MySQL, Redis, Beanstalkd, PHP, and
much more.

### Build Lifecycle / Continuous Delivery / Continuous Integration

I have deep experience setting up and managing build servers including
[JetBrains' TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) and
[Atlassian's Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/).

I can create a complete lifecycle that takes developer code and automates everything
from running unit/behavioral tests, checking code quality, setting up dependencies,
backing up current deployment and deploying new release, all transparently and effortlessly.

### HTML5 / CSS / Javascript

While I am not a dedicated frontend developer, I have created usable interfaces to display
complex data and can create the Javascript to help power those interfaces.

Being a full-stack developer, I can join the powerful PHP backend to a usable and friendly
frontend.
